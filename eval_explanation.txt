Eval function:

We either get the utilty value as 1, -1 or 0.
1 = MAX player wins
-1 = MAX player loses
0 = Draw

The eval function is called when we reach the depth limit.
In the eval function, I am checking for connections of 2 or 3 along with 4 connects.
If the connect is found in either horizontal, vertical or diagonal check; counter is incremented accordingly.
Then in the eval function, heuristic values are multiplied and added to the connects to get the final score of both the players.
 
 maxValue = (max4Connect * 1)+(max3Connect * 0.6) + (max2Connect * 0.2)
 minValue = (min4Connect * 1)+(min3Connect * 0.6) + (min2Connect * 0.2)
 
 According to the scores received, the AI player makes the next move.
